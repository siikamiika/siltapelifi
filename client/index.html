    <p>Click on an island to start building a bridge. Then click on another island to place the bridge. If the move is invalid <span style="color: gray;">(i.e. the maximum number of bridges connected to one of the islands is exceeded, you are trying to build a third bridge between islands, or you are trying to build a bridge that is not parallel to the rows or columns)</span>, nothing happens.</p>
